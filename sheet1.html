				Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 
				1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled 
				it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, 
				but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. 
				It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing 
				Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software 
				like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

			      The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham
